PECL
----

PECL extensions are pre-built for Windows and available from:
<a href="http://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/" class="link external">» http://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/</a>

Some extensions use features specific to some Unix systems and so are
not available on Windows. Otherwise, all extensions are available for
Windows.
