Integer values in function parameters
-------------------------------------

With the advent of PHP 5.0.x, a new parameter parsing API was introduced
which is used by a large number of PHP functions. In all versions of PHP
between 5.0.x and 5.1.x, the handling of integer values was very strict
and would reject non-well formed numeric values when a PHP function
expected an integer. These checks have now been relaxed to support
non-well formed numeric strings such as " 123" and "123 ", and will no
longer fail as they did under PHP 5.0.x. However, to promote code safety
and input validation, PHP functions will now emit an **`E_NOTICE`** when
such strings are passed as integers.
