Overview
--------

From the PHP script writer's point of view, the change most likely to
impact legacy code is in the way that references are handled in all PHP
versions post-dating the PHP 4.4.0 release.

Until and including PHP 4.3, it was possible to send, assign or return
variables by reference that should really be returned by value, such as
a constant, a temporary value (e.g. the result of an expression), or the
result of a function that had itself been returned by value, as here:

``` php
<?php
$foo = "123";

function return_value() {
    global $foo;
    return $foo;
}

$bar = &return_value();
?>
```

Although this code would usually work as expected under PHP 4.3, in the
general case the result is undefined. The Zend Engine could not act
correctly on these values as references. This bug could and did lead to
various hard-to-reproduce memory corruption problems, particularly where
the code base was large.

In PHP 4.4.0, PHP 5.0.4 and all subsequent PHP releases, the Engine was
fixed to 'know' when the reference operation is being used on a value
that should not be referenced. The actual value is now used in such
cases, and a warning is emitted. The warning takes the form of an
**`E_NOTICE`** in PHP 4.4.0 and up, and **`E_STRICT`** in PHP 5.0.4 and
up.

Code that could potentially produce memory corruption can no longer do
so. However, some legacy code might work differently as a result.

Code that worked under PHP 4.3, but now fails
---------------------------------------------

``` php
<?php
function func(&$arraykey) {
    return $arraykey; // function returns by value!
}

$array = array('a', 'b', 'c');
foreach (array_keys($array) as $key) {
    $y = &func($array[$key]);
    $z[] =& $y;
}

var_dump($z);
?>
<
```

Running the above script under any version of PHP that pre-dates the
reference fix would produce this output:

    array(3) {
      [0]=>
      &string(1) "a"
      [1]=>
      &string(1) "b"
      [2]=>
      &string(1) "c"
    }

Following the reference fix, the same code would result in:

    array(3) {
      [0]=>
      &string(1) "c"
      [1]=>
      &string(1) "c"
      [2]=>
      &string(1) "c"
    }

This is because, following the changes, *func()* assigns by value. The
value of `$y` is re-assigned, and reference-binding is preserved from
`$z`. Prior to the fix, the value was assigned by reference, leading
`$y` to be re-bound on each assignment. The attempt to bind to a
temporary value by reference was the cause of the memory corruption.

Such code can be made to work identically in both the pre-fix and the
post-fix PHP versions. The signature of *func()* can be altered to
return by reference, or the reference assignment can be removed from the
result of *func()*.

``` php
<?php
function func() {
    return 'function return';
}

$x = 'original value';
$y =& $x;
$y = &func();
echo $x;
?>
```

In PHP 4.3 `$x` would be 'original value', whereas after the changes it
would be 'function return' - remember that where the function does not
return by reference, the reference assignment is converted to a regular
assignment. Again, this can be brought to a common base, either by
forcing *func()* to return by reference or by eliminating the
by-reference assignment.

Code that worked under PHP 4.3.x, but now throws an error
---------------------------------------------------------

``` php
<?php
class Foo {

    function getThis() {
        return $this;
    }

    function destroyThis() {
        $baz =& $this->getThis();
    }
}

$bar = new Foo();
$bar->destroyThis();
var_dump($bar);
?>
```

In PHP 5.0.3, `$bar` evaluated to **`NULL`** instead of returning an
object. That happened because *getThis()* returns by value, but the
value here is assigned by reference. Although it now works in the
expected way, this is actually invalid code which will throw an
**`E_NOTICE`** under PHP 4.4 or an **`E_STRICT`** under PHP 5.0.4 and
up.

Code that failed under PHP 4.3.x, but now works
-----------------------------------------------

``` php
<?php
function &f() {
    $x = "foo";
    var_dump($x);
    print "$x\n";
    return($a);
}

for ($i = 0; $i < 3; $i++) {
    $h = &f();
}
?>
```

In PHP 4.3 the third call to <span class="function">var\_dump</span>
produces **`NULL`**, due to the memory corruption caused by returning an
uninitialized value by reference. This is valid code in PHP 5.0.4 and
up, but threw errors in earlier releases of PHP.

``` php
<?php
$arr = array('a1' => array('alfa' => 'ok'));
$arr =& $arr['a1'];
echo '-'.$arr['alfa']."-\n";
?>
```

Until PHP 5.0.5, it wasn't possible to assign an array element by
reference in this way. It now is.

Code that *should have worked* under PHP 5.0.x
----------------------------------------------

There are a couple of instances of bugs reported under PHP 5.0 prior to
the reference fixes which now 'work'. However, in both cases errors are
thrown by PHP 5.1.x, because the code was invalid in the first place.
Returning values by reference using *self::* now works in the general
case but throws an **`E_STRICT`** warning, and although your mileage may
vary when assigning by reference to an overloaded object, you will still
see an **`E_ERROR`** when you try it, even where the assignment itself
appears to work.

Warnings that came and went
---------------------------

Nested calls to functions returning by reference are valid code under
both PHP 4.3.x and PHP 5.1.x, but threw an unwarranted **`E_NOTICE`** or
**`E_STRICT`** under the intervening PHP releases.

``` php
<?php
function & foo() {
    $var = 'ok';
    return $var;
}

function & bar() {
    return foo();
}

$a =& bar();
echo "$a\n";
?>
```
