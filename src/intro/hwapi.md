Hyperwave is an information system similar to a database (HIS, Hyperwave
Information Server). Its focus is the storage and management of
documents. A document can be any possible piece of data that may as well
be stored in file. Each document is accompanied by its object record.
The object record contains meta data for the document. The meta data is
a list of attributes which can be extended by the user. Certain
attributes are always set by the Hyperwave server, other may be modified
by the user.
