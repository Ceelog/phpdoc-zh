The OGG/Vorbis file format, as defined by
<a href="http://www.vorbis.com/" class="link external">» http://www.vorbis.com/</a>,
is a scheme for compressing audio streams by multiple factors with a
minimum of quality loss. This extension adds Ogg Vorbis support to PHP's
<a href="/wrappers.html" class="link">URL Wrappers</a>. When used in
read mode, compressed OGG/Vorbis data is expanded to raw PCM audio in
one of six PCM encoding formats listed in the
<a href="/oggvorbis/constants.html" class="link">predefined constants</a>
section.
