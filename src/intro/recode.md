This module contains an interface to the GNU Recode library. The GNU
Recode library converts files between various coded character sets and
surface encodings. When this cannot be achieved exactly, it may get rid
of the offending characters or fall back on approximations. The library
recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able
to convert files between almost any pair. Most
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345" class="link external">» RFC 1345</a>
character sets are supported.
