This is a PHP language extension for RedHat Newt library, a
terminal-based window and widget library for writing applications with
user friendly interface. Once this extension is enabled in PHP it will
provide the use of Newt widgets, such as windows, buttons, checkboxes,
radiobuttons, labels, editboxes, scrolls, textareas, scales, etc. Use of
this extension is very similar to the original Newt API of C programming
language.
