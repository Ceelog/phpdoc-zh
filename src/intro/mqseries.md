This extension aims to provide an interface for communicating with IBMs
WebSphere MQ series Queue managers.

The interface mimics the C-API client interface of WebSphere MQ Series
as close as possible. Using the same naming conventions and
possibilities of the C-API. In order to understand the workings of this
extension some level of understanding the C-API is required.

For MQ-options, MQ-structures, MQ-results etc. please read the WebSphere
MQ Application Programming Guide and WebSphere MQ Application
Programming Reference.
