Gmagick is a php extension to create, modify and obtain meta information
of images using the GraphicsMagick API.

GraphicsMagick prides itself as the swiss army knife of image
processing. It works with over 88 major formats including important
formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF.

Gmagick consists of a main Gmagick class, a GmagickDraw class which is
in effect a drawing wand and a GmagickPixel class of which instances
represent a single pixel of an image (color, opacity).
