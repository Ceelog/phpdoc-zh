The SNMP extension provides a very simple and easily usable toolset for
managing remote devices via the Simple Network Management Protocol.

As it is a wrapper around the underlying Net-SNMP library, all basic
concepts are the same and the PHP functions change their behaviour
depending on the Net-SNMP configuration files and environment variables.
