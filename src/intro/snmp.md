The SNMP extension provides a very simple and easily usable toolset for
managing remote devices via the Simple Network Management Protocol.

As it is a wrapper around the underlying Net-SNMP (or UCD-SNMP on older
systems) library, all basic concepts are the same and the PHP functions
change their behaviour depending on the Net-SNMP configuration files and
environment variables.

Beginning with PHP 5.4, an OO API is available.
