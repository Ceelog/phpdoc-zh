APCu is APC stripped of opcode caching.

The first APCu codebase was versioned 4.0.0, it was forked from the head
of the APC master branch at the time.

PHP 7 support is available as of APCu 5.0.0.

APCu can provide a compatibility mode, such that it can provide a drop
in replacement for the applicable parts of APC.
