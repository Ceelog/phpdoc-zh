The PDF functions in PHP can create PDF files using the PDFlib library
from PDFlib GmbH
(<a href="http://www.pdflib.com/products/pdflib-family/" class="link external">» www.pdflib.com</a>).
A restricted version called PDFlib Lite 7 is available for free, but it
is no longer maintained since 2010. PDFlib integration for PHP is still
actively maintained by PDFlib GmbH. It is mainly targeted at the
commercial PDFlib versions, but can also be used for the old PDFlib
Lite.

If you want to use PDFlib we urge you start with the examples which are
included in all PDFlib packages, and refer to the extensive manuals in
PDF format which are also included. At a minimum you should take a look
at the hello.php sample to learn basic setup for PDFlib usage.
