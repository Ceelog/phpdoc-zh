Enchant is the PHP binding for the
<a href="http://www.abisource.com/projects/enchant/" class="link external">» Enchant library</a>.
Enchant steps in to provide uniformity and conformity on top of all
spelling libraries, and implement certain features that may be lacking
in any individual provider library. Everything should "just work" for
any and every definition of "just working."

Enchant supports the following backends:

-   *Aspell/Pspell (intends to replace Ispell)*

-   *Ispell (old as sin, could be interpreted as a defacto standard)*

-   *MySpell/Hunspell (an OOo projects, also used by Mozilla)*

-   *Uspell (primarily Yiddish, Hebrew, and Eastern European languages -
    hosted in AbiWord's CVS under the module "uspell")*

-   *Hspell (Hebrew)*

-   *AppleSpell (Mac OSX)*
