This extension aims to help parse BBCode text in order to convert it to
HTML or another markup language. It uses one pass parsing and provides
great speed improvement over the common approach based on regular
expressions. Further more, it helps provide valid HTML by reordering
open / close tags and by automatically closing unclosed tags.

Since 0.10.1 It supports argument quoting with single quotes, double
quotes and HTML escaped double quotes.
