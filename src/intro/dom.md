The DOM extension allows you to operate on XML documents through the DOM
API with PHP.

> **Note**:
>
> The DOM extension uses UTF-8 encoding. Use <span
> class="function">utf8\_encode</span> and <span
> class="function">utf8\_decode</span> to work with texts in ISO-8859-1
> encoding or <a href="/ref/iconv.html" class="link">iconv</a> for other
> encodings.
