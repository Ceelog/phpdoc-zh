<a href="http://gearman.org" class="link external">» Gearman</a> is a
generic application framework for farming out work to multiple machines
or processes. It allows applications to complete tasks in parallel, to
load balance processing, and to call functions between languages. The
framework can be used in a variety of applications, from
high-availability web sites to the transport of database replication
events.

This extension provides classes for writing Gearman clients and workers.
