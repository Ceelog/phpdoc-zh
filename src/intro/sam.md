This extension provides access to the functionality of messaging and
queueing systems, such as the IBM WebSphere MQSeries family of products,
from PHP scripts. The interface is designed to make it extremely simple
to do the more commonly required tasks such as deliver simple text
messages to queues while still allowing skilled users to do more complex
messaging operations. For many users the complexities of setting up
numerous options can be simply ignored.

The SAM extension is a framework that provides a very simple API that
can be used to access a number of messaging middleware systems.
Currently the package includes built-in support for the MQTT (MQ
Telemetry Transport) messaging protocol and support for the IBM
Messaging and Queuing middleware products. SAM is designed to be readily
extended to support other messaging systems and extension modules may be
written in C or PHP.
