This is the XMLWriter extension. It wraps the libxml xmlWriter API.

This extension represents a writer that provides a non-cached,
forward-only means of generating streams or files containing XML data.

This extension can be used in an object oriented style or a procedural
one. Every method documented describes the alternative procedural call.
