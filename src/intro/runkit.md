The runkit extension provides means to modify constants, user-defined
functions, and user-defined classes. It also provides for custom
superglobal variables and embeddable sub-interpreters via sandboxing.

This package is meant as a feature added replacement for the
<a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/classkit" class="link external">» classkit</a>
package. When compiled with the *--enable-runkit=classkit* option to
./configure, it will export classkit compatible function definitions and
constants.
