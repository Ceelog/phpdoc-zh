These functions allow you to access the mnoGoSearch (former UdmSearch)
free search engine. mnoGoSearch is a full-featured search engine
software for intranet and internet servers, distributed under the GNU
license. mnoGoSearch has a number of unique features, which makes it
appropriate for a wide range of applications from search within your
site to a specialized search system such as cooking recipes or newspaper
search, FTP archive search, news articles search, etc. It offers
full-text indexing and searching for HTML, PDF, and text documents.
mnoGoSearch consists of two parts. The first is an indexing mechanism
(indexer). The purpose of the indexer is to walk through HTTP, FTP, NEWS
servers or local files, recursively grabbing all the documents and
storing meta-data about that documents in an SQL database in a smart and
effective manner. After every document is referenced by its
corresponding URL, meta-data is collected by the indexer for later use
in a search process. The search is performed via Web interface. C, CGI,
PHP and Perl search front ends are included.
