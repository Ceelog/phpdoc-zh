Rar is a powerful and effective archiver created by Eugene Roshal. This
extension gives you possibility to read Rar archives but doesn't support
writing Rar archives, because this is not supported by the UnRar library
and is directly prohibited by its license.

More information about Rar and UnRar can be found at
