These math functions will only handle values within the range of the
<span class="type">int</span> and <span class="type">float</span> types
on your computer (this corresponds currently to the C types long resp.
double). If you need to handle bigger numbers, take a look at the
<a href="/book/bc.html" class="link">arbitrary precision math functions</a>.
