预定义常量
==========

For each WebSphere MQ Constant there is a mqseries counterpart.

For definitions and usage see the WebSphere MQ Application Programming
Guide and WebSphere MQ Application Programming Reference red books.

The name of the mqseries counterpart is made by appending the WebSphere
MQ constant with MQSERIES\_, for example the CompletionCode constants
are:

| PHP Constant            | MQ Constant   |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| MQSERIES\_MQCC\_OK      | MQCC\_OK      |
| MQSERIES\_MQCC\_WARNING | MQCC\_WARNING |
| MQSERIES\_MQCC\_FAILED  | MQCC\_FAILED  |
| MQSERIES\_MQCC\_UNKNOWN | MQCC\_UNKNOWN |
