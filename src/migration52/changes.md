What has changed in PHP 5.2.x
-----------------------------

Most improvements in PHP 5.2.x have no impact on existing code. There
are a
<a href="/migration52/incompatible.html" class="link">few incompatibilities</a>
and
<a href="/migration52/error-messages.html" class="link">new error messages</a>
that should be considered, and code should be tested before switching
PHP versions in production environments.

If the system is being upgraded from PHP 5.0.x, the manual section
titled
<a href="/migration51.html" class="link">Upgrade Notes for PHP 5.1.x</a>
should also be read.

Similarly, if the system is being upgraded from PHP 4, the manual
section titled
<a href="/migration5.html" class="link">Migrating from PHP 4 to PHP 5</a>
should be read as well.
