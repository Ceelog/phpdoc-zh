Testing an extension
--------------------

One of the accepted requirements of good programming is testing. PHP
provides a test harness for unit regression tests, in the form of a
script called **run-tests.php**.

Tests for a particular module are stored in the `tests/` subdirectory of
the module's folder, and have a `.phpt` extension. For details of the
PHPT format, see
